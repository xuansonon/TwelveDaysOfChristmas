# TwelveDaysOfChristmas
In light of the Christmas spirit, I have written the code for your own computer to sing to your the lyrics from Twleve Days of Christmas. Sure it doesn't actually sing with sound, but it will print out the lyrics. The aim of this code is to not print out everything, but to keep the source code as small as possible.
<br />
<br />
Note: I could have replaced the function intToString with an array like the others (day and gifts), but I thought this would be better. Of course, this goes against my initial goal to keep the code as small as possible, but why not?
<br />
<br />
**How to start the application**<br />
```
java TwelveDaysOfChristmas
```
**Example Output**<br />
```
On the first day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
A Partridge in a Pear Tree

On the second day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
Two Turtle Doves
and A Partridge in a Pear Tree

On the third day of Christmas
My true love gave to me:
Three French Hens
Two Turtle Doves
and A Partridge in a Pear Tree

...
```

**Still to do**
- [X] ~~Replace number of gifts (i.e 2 Turtle Doves) with words (i.e Two Turtle Doves).~~
- [ ] Enable users to enter in their own gifts.

## Merry Christmas, and a Happy New Year! ##
